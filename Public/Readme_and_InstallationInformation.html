			<h2>SAPUI5 Evaluation</h2>
			Welcome to SAPUI5! <br/>Thank you for downloading the SAPUI5 &quot;Evaluation&quot; version.<br/>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			SAPUI5 is a state-of-the-art client-side rendering framework that:
			<ul>
				<li>... provides RIA-style AJAX features</li>
				<li>... supports the SAP product standards</li>
				<li>... offers an extensibility concept</li>
				<li>... allows theming and customer branding</li>
				<li>... comes with a rich set of controls for building desktop as well as mobile applications</li>
				<li>... introduces controls that work on all form factors</li>

			<h2>SAPUI5 Installation</h2>
<p>To use the archives you have downloaded, follow the installation information.</p>
<p>The installation section here is set up according to the various file packages sapui5-sdk-static.zip, sapui5-sdk.war, sapui5-static.zip, sapui5.war, and getting-started-sample.war as they are provided with the downloaded archive for using SAPUI5.</p>


<h3><a name="demostatic">"SAPUI5 SDK Static": sapui5-sdk-static.zip</a></h3>
<p>Extract the sapui5-sdk-static.zip file to the web server that is available at your site. Under Developer Guide -> General Information -> Release Notes you can find some information with respect to what has changed in the current SAPUI5 version 1.12.1 compared to other older SAPUI5 versions. This is a short description of the most important content that is provided:</p>
<p><tt>/resources: </tt></p>
<p>Provides the JavaScript framework and control resource files required for setup, development, and debugging when working with the SAPUI5 user interface technology. The folder for example also contains the sap-ui-core-all.js file which is used in the sample included at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><tt>/test-resources: </tt></p>
<p>The test resources are the basis of the included test suite which is an add-on to the SAPUI5 feature set and which allows you to exercise lively on the control examples, and to reuse examples, or parts of them, where required.</p>
<p><tt>index.html:</tt></p>
<p>Informs about the demo kit and provides basic information of the platform. The file is also preconfigured to be used as starting point for the whole bundle.</p>
<p>To install the sapui5-sdk-static.zip file on an Apache HTTPD server, the steps are as following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the Apache HTTPD server.</li>
<li>Go into the Apache HTTPD server directory on your computer.</li>
<li>Go into the /htdocs folder.</li>
<li>Extract the zip file into folder /sapui5.</li>
<li>Generally, you would use port 8080 to let the demo kit run in the browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>To install the sapui5-sdk-static.zip file on Microsoft IIS, proceed steps as following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Microsoft IIS by using the Windows Program Manager. Activate the Microsoft Internet Information Services.</li>
<li>Open the Microsoft IIS /inetpub directory.</li>
<li>Open the Microsoft IIS /wwwroot folder.</li>
<li>Extract the zip file to a folder /sapui5.</li>
<li>For typical installations you would use port 80 to let the application run.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="demo">"SAPUI5 SDK"</a>: sapui5-sdk.war</h3> 
<p>The demo kit web application archive file contains the same application as the static version described above. You would use this demo kit package file alternatively to the sapui5-sdk-static.zip file for direct deployment on a Java Web Container. As an additional feature a search is available with this version as opposed to the static version. You directly deploy the current package file to the Java Web Container which is available at your site, for example Apache Tomcat; we recommend the newest 6.x version. You do not have to extract the web archive file before.</p>
<p>If you wanted to deploy the .war file to Apache Tomcat for example, you would follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop the Tomcat server if it has been started and is running.</li>
<li>Delete existing deployments, if there are any. The relevant folder for deployments is TOMCAT_HOME/webapps.</li>
<li>Copy the sapui5-sdk.war file to the /webapps directory.</li>
<li>Start the server again.</li>
<li>You do not have to adapt the server.xml file, this is done automatically.</li>  
</ol>
<h3><a name="rtstatic">SAPUI5 runtime static : sapui5-static.zip</a></h3>
<p>The SAPUI5 static bundle consists of static web content only: HTML, JavaScript files, style sheets, and images. It does not include any active components like Servlets which would for example require a running Java web container. The SAPUI5 static bundle contains the SAPUI5 core library, and a set of basic UI libraries.</p>
<p>Using a common standard web server plus the content of the static SAPUI5 runtime .zip file allows you to test and try and find out the SAPUI5 features and functions. The sapui5-static.zip file contains analogous to the demo kit zip file resources and test resources, as well as an index.html for your convenience.</p>

<p>For the installation of this static file version, follow the steps as they are described for <a href="#demostatic">sapui5-sdk-static.zip.</a></p>

<h3><a name="rt">SAPUI5 runtime: sapui5.war</a></h3>
<p>This archive can be used for direct deployment on a Java Web Container like Apache Tomcat. It contains the same client side runtime parts as the static runtime version. However, it also includes some optional Java server components which optimize the resource loading mechanisms if present. An example are the language dependent resource bundles. If a required language bundle doesn't exist, the static version without the server component will have to issue several requests before a fallback file is found. The .war version will resolve this on the server within the first request.</p>

<p>For information on how to proceed with the runtime package, check the information which is available for the <a href="#demo">SAPUI5 SDK web archive</a>.

<h3><a name="hwcrt">SAPUI5 runtime for mobile hybrid web containers: sapui5-mobile-static.zip</a></h3>

<p>SAPUI5 Mobile apps can be built either as web applications which are loaded from a certain URL, or as so-called "Hybrid Apps" which have a native app wrapper, but the entire user interface consists of a HTML viewer where the normal SAPUI5 content is displayed.</p>
<p>Both have advantages and disadvantages. Hybrid apps can be published in App Stores, the whole application code and the UI5 library files can also be embedded into this Hybrid container, so these files are rather installed once than downloaded on every application start. On the other hand this means that the total library size matters because every user has to install everything. In normal web applications the library deployed on the server may be huge, but only the needed parts are downloaded at runtime.</p>
<p>For these hybrid apps, the static package of SAPUI5 Mobile can be used to include all needed SAPUI5 resources, but still have a relatively small total library size because all test pages etc. are removed from this special package. The file is sapui5-mobile-static.zip.</p>
<p>It contains the debug version of all Javascript files as well as the optimized and minified one (which are used by default) so it can be used for productive as well as debug purposes.</p>
<p>To use this package e.g. in Sybase's Hybrid Web Container or Adobe's PhoneGap, it just needs to be unzipped inside the respective resource location of the app development project. The Hybrid Web Container/PhoneGap build will then include the files and make them available at runtime.</p>

<h4>Optimizing the package size: Delete unneeded files</h4>
<p>While the above file is already pretty small (and small enough for inclusion in hybrid apps), the size can be further reduced and optimized for specific applications by deleting unneeded files:</p>
<ul>
<li>In /resources you can delete either sap-ui-core-nojQuery.js if you reference UI5 normally, or sap-ui-core.js if you reference the nojQuery version and reference jQuery separately (e.g. because you run in a Sybase Hybrid Container).</li>
<li>In /resources/sap you can delete the entire makit folder when you do not need the makit charts.</li>
<li>In /resources/sap/ui/thirdparty you can delete the entire jquery and jqueryui folders when you use the normal sap-ui-core.js file for bootstrap (they may only be needed when using the sap-ui-core-nojQuery.js script, and even then you may have another copy of jQuery available, so that folder can still be deleted).</li>
<li>In /resources/sap/ui/core/themes and in /resources/sap/m/themes you can delete the "base" and the "sap_bluecrystal" folder (unless you are using this experimental theme, then you can delete "base" and "sap_mvi")</li>
</ul>
<p>Of all JavaScript files there is an optimized and a "-dbg" version of each file, so when deleting the above files make sure you always delete both versions of them! 
If you do not want to allow easy debugging and you want to go for minimum installation size, also ALL *-dbg.js files can be deleted from the "-opt-static" package.</p>

<p>Further files can be deleted, but the size reduction is limited and finding out what is not required gets increasingly difficult.</p>

<h3>Sample application: getting-started-sample.war</h3>
<p>Importing the content of the getting-started-sample file, which you have extracted before or deployed directly to your web container into an Eclipse IDE (for prerequisites and IDE version, check the prerequisites for the <a href="#tools">SAPUI5 Application Development Tools</a>), you get a sophisticated SAPUI5 Application example which you can adapt for your purposes. The SAPUI5 Application Project is preconfigured in a way that you can directly let it run on your web server; enhance it with the SAPUI5 controls that fit for your application needs. The getting-started-sample file provides pre-thought steps which are already implemented for your convenience. For example, you can directly use the library packages as they are available in WebContent -> WEB-INF -> lib. The programming model foresees that it is sufficient to have the Java archive files available in the SAPUI5 Application Project, it is not necessary to extract these before using them.</p>


<p>For just having a glance what a SAPUI5 Application looks like in the browser, you also could deploy it to your Web container only, and let it run via http://localhost:8080/getting-started-sample.</p> 

<h3><a name="tools">SAPUI5 Application Development Tool: tools-updatesite </a></h3>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<p>SAPUI5 Tools run on the following supported operating systems: Microsoft Windows XP, Microsoft Windows Vista and Microsoft Windows 7. As Java Runtime, version JRE 1.6, 32/64-Bit is required. Use the same runtime version for the open source toolset for development, Eclipse. Download the recommended JEE bundle version Indigo 3.7 from an Eclipse download site. Ensure that the feature folders which are listed in the table below are available in the Eclipse version you are installing. If not, perform a post-installation task by downloading the feature plug-ins manually. In the Install New Software dialog make sure to uncheck Group items by category. Otherwise it might happen that not all required features are found. You can use the filter to locate the features quickly. </p>
